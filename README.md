# Python Repository

### Introduction
Hello eveyone!

This is a repository I've created to document my learnings of Python. It will be divided into sections, containg both simple Python files to understand key concepts, as well as more complex projects, in order to put these concepts into practice, as well as experimenting with new ideas along the journey.

### Sections
1. <strong>[Python Quick Review](/01_python_quick_review/)</strong> - Contains simple Python revision, such as syntax, and working with JSON and HTTP requests.
2. <strong>[REST API with Python](/02_rest_api_with_python/)</strong> - Simple REST API with CRUD operations, created with Python. Use of libraries such as FastAPI, Pydantic and TinyDB.
3. <strong>[OpenAI API](/03_openai_api/)</strong> - Python files with basic usage of the OpenAI API. Includes text generation, embeddings, speech to text, text to speech and image generation examples.
4. <strong>[Streamlit](/04_streamlit/)</strong> - Python file covering the main basics of Streamlit, a Python library used for building Web Interfaces.
5. <strong>[Zero Shot Sentiment Analysis (Project)](/05_zero_shot_sentiment_analysis/)</strong> - Web App using Streamlit and the OpenAI API for zero-shot sentiment analysis. Users input text or emotions, and the app analyzes sentiment dynamically, offering a user-friendly interface.
